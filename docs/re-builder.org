When the command ~re-builder~ is invoked, a buffer named "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎" is created. Activate Casual RE-Builder with the binding {{{kbd(C-o}}} (or one of your preference). 

At the top of the menu shows the title "RE-Builder" with the target buffer enclosed in parenthesis. The regexp pattern will be applied to the target buffer. The target buffer can be changed with the “{{{kbd(b)}}} Target buffer” menu item.

Emacs supports three different regexp syntax: 1) read, 2) string, 3) Rx.  Use the “{{{kbd(x)}}} Syntax” menu item to alter it. The current syntax is shown in parenthesis.

If multiple sub-expressions are in the regexp pattern, then they can be observed via the “{{{kbd(s)}}} Subexp mode” menu item.

If the regexp pattern entered in "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎" finds multiple matches, a match can be navigated to via the  “{{{kbd(p)}}} Previous” and “{{{kbd(n)}}} Next” menu items.

#+TEXINFO: @subsubheading Exporting the Regexp Pattern
Once a desired regexp pattern is defined, there are two menu items that can be used to export (copy) it to the kill-ring for further use.

- “{{{kbd(w)}}} Interactive” will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked in an interactive command that requires a regexp (e.g. ~query-replace-regexp~).
  - This can only be used when the regexp syntax is set to ~string~.
  - ❗️When yanking (typically {{{kbd(C-y)}}}) a regexp into an interactive prompt, you /must/ have the point/focus in the minibuffer prompt (typically via mouse). Otherwise the desired content can be altered with extra escaping.
- “{{{kbd(c)}}} Code” will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked into a Elisp code that requires a regexp argument.
- “{{{kbd(g)}}} Interactive grep” will copy the regexp so that it can be used with command that take a GNU grep regex argument.
  - Example commands that do this are ~dired-do-find-regexp~ and ~dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace~.
  - This command presumes that you have GNU grep installed and configured for use by Emacs.
  - ❗️At current this is an experimental feature. The regexp exported from RE-Builder may not work. If so please report an [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-re-builder/issues][issue]] describing the desired regexp and the target text.
  - This can only be used when the regexp syntax is set to ~string~.
