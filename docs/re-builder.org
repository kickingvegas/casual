* Casual RE-Builder
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based user interface for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Regular-Expressions.html][RE-Builder]], a tool for building Emacs regular expressions (regexps).

* Install
If installed via [[https://melpa.org/#/casual-re-builder][MELPA]] then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-re-builder) ; optional
  (keymap-set reb-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-re-builder-tmenu)
  (keymap-set reb-lisp-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-re-builder-tmenu)
#+end_src

* Usage

** Basic Usage
When the command ~re-builder~ is invoked, a buffer named "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎" is created. Activate Casual RE-Builder with the binding ~C-o~ (or one of your preference). 

At the top of the menu shows the title "RE-Builder" with the target buffer enclosed in parenthesis. The regexp pattern will be applied to the target buffer. The target buffer can be changed with the /(b) Target buffer/ menu item.

Emacs supports three different regexp syntax: 1) read, 2) string, 3) Rx.  Use the /(x) Syntax/ menu item to alter it. The current syntax is shown in parenthesis.

If multiple sub-expressions are in the regexp pattern, then they can be observed via the /(s) Subexp mode/ menu item.

If the regexp pattern entered in the "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎" finds multiple matches, a match can be navigated to via the /(p) Previous/ and /(n) Next/ menu items.

** Exporting the Regexp Pattern
Once a desired regexp pattern is defined, there are two menu items that can be used to export (copy) it to the kill-ring for further use.

- /(w) Interactive/ will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked in an interactive command that requires a regexp (e.g. ~query-replace-regexp~).
  - This can only be used when the regexp syntax is set to ~string~.
  - ❗️When yanking (typically ~C-y~) a regexp into an interactive prompt, you /must/ have the point/focus in the minibuffer prompt (typically via mouse). Otherwise the desired content can be altered with extra escaping.
- /(c) Code/ will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked into a Elisp code that requires a regexp argument.
- /(g) Interactive grep/ will copy the regexp so that it can be used with command that take a GNU grep regex argument.
  - Example commands that do this are ~dired-do-find-regexp~ and ~dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace~.
  - This command presumes that you have GNU grep installed and configured for use by Emacs.
  - ❗️At current this is an experimental feature. The regexp exported from RE-Builder may not work. If so please report an [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-re-builder/issues][issue]] describing the desired regexp and the target text.
  - This can only be used when the regexp syntax is set to ~string~.    

** Regexp Syntax Help
The menu item /(i)/ will invoke the Info page for regexp syntax with respect to the current syntax type.

** Quitting RE-Builder
Select /(q) Quit/ to exit the RE-Builder tool. 

** Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual RE-Builder will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus. The following mapping is shown in the table below:

| Name      | Plain    | Unicode |
|-----------+----------+---------|
| :previous | Previous | ↑       |
| :next     | Next     | ↓       |
