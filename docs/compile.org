Casual Compile is a user interface for the output of the ~compile~ command ([[info:emacs#Compilation]]). The output buffer's major mode is ~compilation-mode~ whose commands are surfaced by Casual Compile.

In similar fashion, output of Emacs-wrapped Grep commands ([[info:emacs#Grep Searching]]) is also supported by Casual Compile. This is because the output of Grep commands use the major mode ~grep-mode~ which is derived from ~compilation-mode~. 

The screenshot below shows the menu for compilation results.

The screenshot below shows the menu for Grep results. Note the menu label changes based on the output mode (in this case ~grep-mode~).

#+CINDEX: Compile Install

In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~casual-compile-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference. It should be bound in two maps: ~compilation-mode-map~ and ~grep-mode-map~.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set compilation-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-compile-tmenu)
  (keymap-set grep-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-compile-tmenu)
#+end_src

~casual-compile-tmenu~ deviates from the default bindings of ~compilation-mode-map~ as shown in the table below to support using a single key on an =en.US= keyboard. 

| Default Binding | Casual Binding | Command                    |
|-----------------+----------------+----------------------------|
| M-p             | k              | compilation-previous-error |
| M-n             | j              | compilation-next-error     |
| M-{             | [              | compilation-previous-file  |
| M-}             | ]              | compilation-next-file      |
| C-o             | o              | compilation-display-error  |

The following keybindings are recommended to support consistent behavior between ~compilation-mode-map~ and ~casual-compile-tmenu~.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set compilation-mode-map "k" #'compilation-previous-error)
  (keymap-set compilation-mode-map "j" #'compilation-next-error)
  (keymap-set compilation-mode-map "o" #'compilation-display-error)
  (keymap-set compilation-mode-map "[" #'compilation-previous-file)
  (keymap-set compilation-mode-map "]" #'compilation-next-file)
#+end_src

Similar treatment for ~grep-mode-map~ can be done. 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set grep-mode-map "k" #'compilation-previous-error)
  (keymap-set grep-mode-map "j" #'compilation-next-error)
  (keymap-set grep-mode-map "o" #'compilation-display-error)
  (keymap-set grep-mode-map "[" #'compilation-previous-file)
  (keymap-set grep-mode-map "]" #'compilation-next-file)
#+END_SRC


** Compile Usage
#+CINDEX: Compile Usage

[[file:images/casual-compile-screenshot.png]]

After running ~compile~, invoke ~casual-compile-tmenu~ in the buffer named =✳︎compilation✳︎= using the binding ~C-o~ (or your binding of preference).

The following sections are offered in the menu:

- Follow :: Navigate the point while opening the location of the error in the source file in another window.
- Error :: Error commands for navigation and viewing.
- File :: If there are errors in multiple files, navigate to the file.
- Compile :: Get compile for different Elisp types. Note that the “{{{kbd(k)}}} Kill” item is displayed when there is a running job.

If the output window is from a Grep command, ~casual-compile-tmenu~ will adjust its labels accordingly as shown below.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Compile Settings
#+VINDEX: casual-compile-settings-tmenu

The menu ~casual-compile-settings-tmenu~ provides access to different ~compilation-mode~ settings.
  
#+TEXINFO: @subheading Compile Mode Unicode Symbol Support

By enabling “{{{kbd(u)}}} Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Compile will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.

For more info on using Unicode symbols, please refer to [[#ux-conventions][UX Conventions]].
