** Man Usage
#+CINDEX: Man Usage

[[file:images/casual-man-screenshot.png]]

The Man page reader can be invoked via ~M-x man~, where the user is prompted for a search key. This search key is typically the name of a command that has an associated Man page. In the Man page window, pressing {{{kbd(C-o)}}} (or your binding of preference) will raise the menu ~casual-man-tmenu~.

The following sections are offered in the menu:

- Navigation :: Navigation commands with the document.
- Paragraph :: Navigation commands by paragraph.
- Section :: Navigation commands by section.
- Link :: Jump to other Man pages referenced in the current Man page.
- Page :: If the Man page reader is configured to display all manual pages for a given search key, navigation commands for multiple pages is provided.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Options Navigation

~casual-man-tmenu~ provides the menu item {{{kbd(o)}}} which runs the command ~casual-man-occur-options~. This will invoke ~occur~ with a regexp that searches for command line options (for example, "--foo", "-a") that can be navigated via the ~occur~ interface.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Man Settings

By default, the Man page reader will /not/ display all manual pages for given search key. This can be changed in the Settings menu ~casual-man-settings-tmenu~ that can be invoked by pressing {{{kbd(\,)}}} in ~casual-man-tmenu~. 

Press ‘s’ and configure ~Man-switches~ to have the value "-a" to get all manual pages.
