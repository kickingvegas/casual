- Navigation :: Commands to move the point to a desired date, adjusting the view as necessary.

- Conversions :: Commands to convert a date across different calendar systems.

- Holidays :: Holiday related commands.

- Misc :: Commands related to the Diary and Org Agenda are placed here.

- Almanac :: Almanac-related commands such the lunar phase, sunrise/sunset times are found here.

- Region :: Support for counting days defined in a region is offered here.

Certain non-Gregorian calendar systems are supported by the diary (Bahá’í, Hebrew, Islamic, Lunar (Chinese)). For such systems, their menus will offer choices to insert diary events.

Note that inserting non-Gregorian diary events require configuration of the variables ~diary-nongregorian-listing-hook~ and ~diary-nongregorian-marking-hook~ as detailed in Diary Entries using non-Gregorian Calendars ([[info:emacs#Non-Gregorian Diary]]).

Both of these variables can be configured from the Calendar Settings menu.

*** Calendar Settings Menu
