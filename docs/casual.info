Casual User Guide
*****************

Version: 2.4.0

Casual is a project to re-imagine the primary user interface for Emacs
using keyboard-driven menus.

Emacs has many commands that are easy to forget if not used frequently.
Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offers discoverability
and recognition.  While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven
UI, the inclusion of Transient (https://github.com/magit/transient) in
Emacs core allows for building menus that are keyboard-driven instead.
This appeals to users that prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

Casual organizes itself primarily around the different built-in modes
Emacs provides.  For each mode Casual supports, there is a bespoke
designed library of Transient menus for that mode's command set.

Casual has no aims to be a mutually exclusive user interface.  All
existing user interfaces to commands (keybinding, mini-buffer prompt,
mouse menus) are still available to the user.

To learn more about the motivations and design considerations for Casual
as well as seeing it at work, please watch the presentation
“Re-imagining the Emacs User Experience with Casual Suite”
(https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/casual/) from EmacsConf 2024.

1 Motivations
*************

Goals
=====

   • To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI toolkit for common Emacs
     commands.

   • To allow for casual discovery and use of infrequently used Emacs
     commands.

   • To be a frequently used interface to the modes Casual does support.

Non-Goals
=========

   • Full coverage of all Emacs commands.  Casual is not intended to be
     a power user tool nor is it intended to be a replacement for
     mouse-driven menus.  Casual has no intent to exhaustively cover all
     modes available in Emacs with keyboard-driven menus.

   • Strict adherence to Emacs command naming.  While Casual is *mostly*
     in alignment with Emacs command naming, there are cases where it
     will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or
     idiomatic.

   • No intention is made by Casual to help on-board users to the
     existing default bindings of a mode, nor to cater to users who
     already know them.  That said, many existing default Emacs bindings
     are replicated in Casual.  Such correspondence should be considered
     incidental.

   • UX Stability (for now).  Given that Casual is early in its
     life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu
     hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

Editorially, all design decisions for Casual are ultimately the opinion
of Charles Y.  Choi.

2 Requirements
**************

Casual requires Emacs 29.1+.

Certain menus require more:

   • Casual Dired: GNU Coreutils
   • Casual Image: ImageMagick 6+


File: casual.info,  Node: Transient Conventions,  Next: Casual Modes,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Top

3 Transient Conventions
***********************

Casual is built using Transient menus and as such adopts its default
behavior.

Each menu item has a _key_ and a _label_.  The _key_ is what is typed by
the user to select the menu item.  A key can be prefixed with a meta
‘M-’ or control ‘C-’ key.

Transient supports nested menus.  Exiting a menu can be done in two
ways:

   • ‘C-g’ (‘transient-quit-one’) will exit the current sub-menu and
     return you back to its parent menu.

   • ‘C-q’ (‘transient-quit-all’) will exit you completely from a
     Transient menu stack.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse
cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ‘?’ key or ‘C-h’ will toggle help for all the menu items.
Press the key of interest to get help for it.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (‘C-u’) and an
optional argument can be entered before selecting a menu item.

For Transient menus that offer setting different values, the following
bindings will allow you save them:

   • ‘C-x s’ (‘transient-set’)

     Saves the value of the active transient for this Emacs session.

   • ‘C-x C-s’ (‘transient-save’)

     Saves the value of the active transient persistently across Emacs
     sessions.

   • ‘C-x C-k’ (‘transient-reset’)

     Clears the set and saved values of the active transient.

4 Casual Modes
**************

Casual employs the convention of using the same keybinding to invoke a
mode-specific main menu.  This keybinding is re-used for each
mode-specific keymap.  The document recommends the default keybinding
‘C-o’ for this purpose.  Users who prefer a different binding are always
free to use another.

Casual is organized into different libraries typically using the naming
convention of ‘casual-<mode name>’.  Each library has within it a "main
menu" which serves as the top level interface to access functions
related to that mode.  All main menus are auto-loaded, which means that
it is not necessary to include a ‘require’ call to load that library.

The following modes are supported by Casual:

* Menu:

* Agenda::
* Bookmarks::
* Calc::
* Calendar::
* Dired::
* EditKit::
* IBuffer::
* Image::
* Info::
* I-Search::
* RE-Builder::

4.1 Agenda
==========

Casual Agenda is a user interface for Org Agenda.  Its top-level library
is ‘casual-agenda’.

Configuration
=============

The main menu for Casual Agenda is the Transient menu
‘casual-agenda-tmenu’.  Bind this menu in the keymap
‘org-agenda-mode-map’ as follows in your initialization file.

     (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-agenda-tmenu)

Use these bindings to configure Org Agenda to be consistent with
bindings used by Casual Agenda.  This is optional.

     ; bindings to make jumping consistent between Org Agenda and Casual Agenda
     (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "M-j" #'org-agenda-clock-goto) ; optional
     (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "J" #'bookmark-jump) ; optional

Usage
=====

Casual Agenda organizes its main menu into the following sections:

   • *Agenda*

     Modify the view duration (day, week, fortnight, month, year).

   • *Filter*

     Filter displayed headlines with different criteria.

   • *Actions*

     Perform an activity on a headline, create/capture a headline or
     even generate a different agenda view.

   • *Navigation*

     Navigate to different agenda items by line, heading, or date.  Move
     the point to where you want it to be.

   • *Utils*

     Miscellaneous commands such as setting a time, showing the
     calendar, and getting almanac information (sunrise/sunset, lunar
     cycle).

References

   • *note Org Agenda: (org)Agenda Views.


File: casual.info,  Node: Bookmarks,  Next: Calc,  Prev: Agenda,  Up: Casual Modes

4.2 Bookmarks
=============

Casual Bookmarks is a user interface for the Emacs Bookmarks list.  Its
top-level library is ‘casual-bookmarks’.

Configuration
=============

The main menu for Casual Bookmarks is ‘casual-bookmarks-tmenu’.  Bind
this menu in the keymap ‘bookmark-bmenu-mode-map’ as follows in your
initialization file.

     (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-bookmarks-tmenu)

Use these keybindings to configure bookmark list to be consistent with
keybindings used by Casual Bookmarks.

     (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "J" #'bookmark-jump)

Casual Bookmarks also includes the keymap ‘casual-bookmarks-main-menu’
which inserts a _Bookmarks_ menu into the main menu bar.

To enable this, add the following configuration to your initialization
file.

     (require 'casual-bookmarks)
     (easy-menu-add-item global-map '(menu-bar)
                         casual-bookmarks-main-menu
                         "Tools")

While not necessary, having the current bookmark highlighted is
convenient.  Enable ‘hl-line-mode’ for the bookmark list as shown below.

     (require 'hl-line)
     (add-hook 'bookmark-bmenu-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)

Finally, customize the variable ‘bookmark-save-flag’ to the value ‘1’ to
ensure that your bookmark changes are always saved.

The above guidance largely extends the work done in the blog post Using
Bookmarks in Emacs like you do in Web Browsers
(http://yummymelon.com/devnull/using-bookmarks-in-emacs-like-you-do-in-web-browsers.html).

     your choosing) to launch the Casual Calc interface.

For nearly all menus, algebraic entry via the ‘'’ binding is available,
as well as basic calculator operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division) and stack operations (pop, enter).

Calc Basics
-----------

It helps to know some basics about Calc.

   • Calc is a stack-based calculator that supports both RPN and
     algebraic style entry.
        • By default it uses RPN entry, but this can be changed to
          algebraic.
   • Stack based operations are always RPN-style.
   • Undo has the keybinding ‘U’, redo is ‘D’.
   • The top of the stack is referred to as ‘1:’
   • Calc vectors are punctuated with ‘[’ and ‘]’ (e.g.  ‘[2 3]’) Matrix
     values are represented as vectors within a vector.  For example,
     ‘[[1 0] [0 1]]’ is a square diagonal matrix.
   • Calc vector indexes are 1-offset.
   • Intervals
        • Inclusive intervals are represented as [𝑛..𝑚], where 𝑛 < 𝑚.
        • Exclusive intervals are represented as (𝑛..𝑚), where 𝑛 < 𝑚.
        • Any combination of lower and upper bounds set to be inclusive
          or exclusive is supported.
   • Complex numbers are entered as (𝑟, 𝑖), where 𝑟 is the real part and
     𝑖 is the imaginary.
   • Radix numbers are entered as 𝑏#𝑛 where 𝑏 is the base value and 𝑛 is
     the number.  For example entering ‘2#0101’ will put ‘5’ on the
     stack.
   • H:M:S values are default entered as ℎ@ 𝑚" 𝑠'.
   • Org-mode active timestamps can be entered into Calc.
   • The top of the stack (1:) can be edited by pressing the ‘`’ key.
   • Entering a single quote ‘'’ will prompt you for an algebraic entry.

4.5 Dired
=========

Casual Dired provides a user interface for Dired, the Emacs file
manager.  Its top-level library is ‘casual-dired’.

Requirements
============

Casual Dired requires that the ‘ls’ utility from GNU coreutils ≥ 8.32 be
installed.

The following links provide guidance for installing GNU coreutils on
different platforms.

macOS
-----

Note that the default packaged ‘ls’ on macOS is BSD-flavored which is
not supported by Casual Dired.  Users wishing to use Casual Dired on
macOS are recommended to install GNU coreutils and configure their Emacs
to point to its version of ‘ls’ accordingly.

   • MacPorts (https://ports.macports.org/port/coreutils/)
   • Homebrew (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils#default)

Windows
-------

For users running on Microsoft Windows, use this guidance
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Dired-ls.html)
to configure Emacs to use an external install of ‘ls’.

   • Git for Windows (https://gitforwindows.org/) (includes ‘ls’ in Git
     BASH)
   • Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/)

Configuration
=============

The main menu for Dired is ‘casual-dired-tmenu’.  Bind this menu in the
keymap ‘dired-mode-map’ as follows in your initialization file.

     (keymap-set dired-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-dired-tmenu)

In addition, it is convenient to have both the sort-by
(‘casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu’) and search & replace
(‘casual-dired-search-replace-tmenu’) menus bound.  Listed below is an
example of binding the sort-by and search & replace menus to ‘s’ and ‘/’
respectively.

     (keymap-set dired-mode-map "s" #'casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu) ; optional
     (keymap-set dired-mode-map "/" #'casual-dired-search-replace-tmenu) ; optional

Usage
=====

   • *File*

     File-related commands are placed here.  Most of the commands will
     also operate on marked files (see *Mark* item below).

   • *Directory*

     Directory-related commands.  Subdir view commands are also made
     available in this section.  To remove a subdir view, use the prefix
     ‘C-u’ before pressing the binding ‘k’ to kill a subdir view.

   • *Mark*

     Marking operations are available here.  Commands in the _Utils_
     sub-menu can be used to operate on marked items.  In addition, many
     commands from the *Files* section can be operate on marked items.

     The _Regexp_ sub-menu provides commands to mark via *note regular
     expression: (elisp)Regular Expressions.

   • *Navigation*

4.6 EditKit
===========

Casual EditKit provides a user interface for the numerous editing
commands offered by Emacs.  Its top-level library is ‘casual-editkit’.
As text editing is a core feature of Emacs, the menus provided here are
intended to be made available in a global fashion for buffers that are
intended to be edited.

Configuration
=============

The main menu for EditKit is ‘casual-editkit-main-tmenu’.  Bind this
menu in the global keymap to have general access to it whenever you are
in a buffer whose mode does _not_ have Casual specific main menu as
follows in your initialization file.

4.7 IBuffer
===========

Casual IBuffer provides a user interface to Emacs IBuffer, a mode
designed for managing buffers.  Its top-level library is
‘casual-ibuffer’.

IBuffer is a powerful tool for managing Emacs workflows.  As Emacs is
often compared to an operating system, through that lens one could
compare IBuffer to being a task manager interface, managing instantiated
buffers as opposed to processes.

Configuration
=============

The main menu for IBuffer is ‘casual-ibuffer-tmenu’.  Bind this menu in
the keymap ‘ibuffer-mode-map’ as follows in your initialization file.

     (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-ibuffer-tmenu)

Like with Casual Dired, it is convenient to have the menus for filtering
and sorting bound as well.  Listed below shows an example of binding
‘casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu’ and ‘casual-ibuffer-sortby-tmenu’ to ‘F’
and ‘s’ respectively.

     (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "F" #'casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu)

4.11 RE-Builder
===============

Casual RE-Builder is a user interface for RE-Builder.  Its top level
library is ‘casual-re-builder’.

Configuration
=============

The main menu for Casual RE-Builder is ‘casual-re-builder-tmenu’.  Bind
this menu in the keymaps ‘reb-mode-map’ and ‘reb-lisp-mode-map’ as
follows in your initialization file.

     (keymap-set reb-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-re-builder-tmenu)
     (keymap-set reb-lisp-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-re-builder-tmenu)

Usage
=====

Basic Usage
-----------

When the command ‘re-builder’ is invoked, a buffer named "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎"
is created.  Activate Casual RE-Builder with the binding ‘C-o’ (or one
of your preference).

At the top of the menu shows the title "RE-Builder" with the target
buffer enclosed in parenthesis.  The regexp pattern will be applied to
the target buffer.  The target buffer can be changed with the (b)
*Target buffer* menu item.

Emacs supports three different regexp syntax: 1) read, 2) string, 3) Rx.
Use the (x) *Syntax* menu item to alter it.  The current syntax is shown
in parenthesis.

If multiple sub-expressions are in the regexp pattern, then they can be
observed via the (s) *Subexp mode* menu item.

If the regexp pattern entered in the "✳︎RE-Builder✳︎" finds multiple
matches, a match can be navigated to via the (p) *Previous* and (n)
*Next* menu items.

Exporting the Regexp Pattern
----------------------------

Once a desired regexp pattern is defined, there are two menu items that
can be used to export (copy) it to the kill-ring for further use.

   • (w) *Interactive* will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it
     can be yanked in an interactive command that requires a regexp
     (e.g.  ‘query-replace-regexp’).
        • This can only be used when the regexp syntax is set to
          ‘string’.
        • ❗️When yanking (typically ‘C-y’) a regexp into an interactive
          prompt, you _must_ have the point/focus in the minibuffer
          prompt (typically via mouse).  Otherwise the desired content
          can be altered with extra escaping.
   • (c) *Code* will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be
     yanked into a Elisp code that requires a regexp argument.
   • (g) *Interactive grep* will copy the regexp so that it can be used
     with command that take a GNU grep regex argument.
        • Example commands that do this are ‘dired-do-find-regexp’ and
          ‘dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace’.
        • This command presumes that you have GNU grep installed and
          configured for use by Emacs.
        • ❗️At current this is an experimental feature.  The regexp
          exported from RE-Builder may not work.  If so please report an
          issue
          (https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-re-builder/issues)
          describing the desired regexp and the target text.
        • This can only be used when the regexp syntax is set to
          ‘string’.

Regexp Syntax Help
------------------

The menu item (i) will invoke the Info page for regexp syntax with
respect to the current syntax type.

Quitting RE-Builder
-------------------

Select (q) *Quit* to exit the RE-Builder tool.

5 UX Conventions
****************

The Casual menus share common user experience (UX) conventions to
facilitate usability.  This section details this.

Common Menu Navigation
======================

Casual organizes a mode's command set into a menu hierarchy.  As the
user descends down different menu levels, the user is given the option
to dismiss the current menu or to dismiss completely all menu levels
descended.  Transient provides a standard convention for menu dismissal
via the ‘C-g’ (‘transient-quit-one’) and ‘C-q’ (‘transient-quit-all’)
commands.  By default Transient does not display these commands in the
menu though, rather they make the assumption that the user already knows
these bindings.

In contrast, Casual makes these bindings explicitly known to user by
displaying them at the bottom of the menu.  Users who wish to have them
hidden can set the customizable variable ‘casual-lib-hide-navigation’ to
a non-nil value.  This can be changed from a Casual mode-specific
settings menu.

Settings Menu
=============

Most all Casual main menus support invoking a mode-specific settings
menu via the binding ','.

Unicode Symbol Support
======================

The customizable variable named ‘casual-lib-use-unicode’ which when
non-nil will inform Casual menus to use Unicode symbol labels whenever
supported.  This can be changed from Casual mode-specific settings menu.

If ‘casual-lib-use-unicode’ is set to ‘t’, it is also recommended that
the variable ‘transient-align-variable-pitch’ also be set to ‘t’.

Common Key Bindings
===================

   • (J) ‘Jump to Bookmark…’

     Casual places great emphasis on using Emacs Bookmarks to track
     different places of note.  The binding ‘J’ is used in many main
     menus to support this.

   • (,) ‘Settings›’

     Many modes have settings specific to them.  The binding ‘,’ is used
     in many main menus to support the configuration of mode-specific
     settings.

   • (j) ‘Goto…’ (mode specific)

     Many modes provide a list of items.  The binding ‘j’ is used to map
     to the command to move the point to an item that the user
     explicitly specifies.

   • (n), (p) ‘Next’, ‘Previous’

     For modes that provide a list of items, navigation to a next or
     previous item is bound to ‘n’ and ‘p’ respectively.

   • ([), (]) ‘Next Section’, ‘Previous Section’

     For modes that organize items into sections, navigation to a next
     or previous section is bound to ‘[’ and ‘]’ respectively.
