The main menu for Casual Info is ~casual-info-tmenu~. Bind this menu in the keymap ~Info-mode-map~ as follows in your initialization file.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set Info-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-info-tmenu)
#+end_src

While not required, adding this configuration to your Emacs initialization file will synchronize keybindings between Casual Info and the Info reader. A nice visual improvement is to use ~hl-line-mode~ to highlight the line where the cursor is at. Enabling ~scroll-lock-mode~ will enable scrolling the buffer for content that is larger than its window size with the navigation keys.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  ;; # Info
  ;; Use web-browser history navigation bindings
  (keymap-set Info-mode-map "M-[" #'Info-history-back)
