Casual IBuffer provides a user interface to Emacs IBuffer ([[info:emacs#Buffer Menus][emacs#Buffer Menus]]), a mode designed for managing buffers. Its top-level library is ~casual-ibuffer~.

IBuffer is a powerful tool for managing Emacs workflows. As Emacs is often compared to an operating system, through that lens one could compare IBuffer to being a task manager interface, managing instantiated buffers as opposed to processes.

#+CINDEX: IBuffer Install

In your initialization file, bind the Transinent ~casual-ibuffer-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference. 

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-ibuffer-tmenu)
#+end_src

Like with Casual Dired, it is convenient to have the menus for filtering and sorting bound as well. Listed below shows an example of binding ~casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu~ and ~casual-ibuffer-sortby-tmenu~ to ~F~ and ~s~ respectively.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "F" #'casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu)
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "s" #'casual-ibuffer-sortby-tmenu)
#+end_src

Use these keybindings to configure IBuffer to be consistent with keybindings used by Casual IBuffer.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "{" #'ibuffer-backwards-next-marked)
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "}" #'ibuffer-forward-next-marked)
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "[" #'ibuffer-backward-filter-group)
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "]" #'ibuffer-forward-filter-group)
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "$" #'ibuffer-toggle-filter-group)  
#+end_src

While not necessary for Casual IBuffer, enabling ~hl-line-mode~ and binding mouse clicks in IBuffer adds to a more comfortable IBuffer experience. Also, adding ~ibuffer-auto-mode~ to ~ibuffer-mode-hook~ will enable auto-updating. 

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'hl-line)
  (require 'mouse)
  (add-hook 'ibuffer-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)
  (add-hook 'ibuffer-mode-hook #'ibuffer-auto-mode)
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "<double-mouse-1>" #'ibuffer-visit-buffer)
  (keymap-set ibuffer-mode-map "M-<double-mouse-1>" #'ibuffer-visit-buffer-other-window)
#+end_src

** IBuffer Usage
#+CINDEX: IBuffer Usage

[[file:images/casual-ibuffer-screenshot.png]]


The main menu of Casual IBuffer (~casual-ibuffer-tmenu~) is organized into the following sections:

- Operations :: Commands to operate either on the buffer at point or on marked buffers.

- Mark :: Commands to support the marking of buffers.

- Display :: Commands to control the display of buffers. Buffers can be sorted by different criteria.

- Navigation :: Commands to navigate the buffer list.

- Filter :: Commands related to filtering/organizing buffers. Support for defining /Filter Groups/ is provided here.

- Find/Replace in Marked :: Commands to search & replace text in marked buffers are provided here. Note that commands in this section that modify buffers do /not/ save said buffers.

- Quick :: Command to jump to a bookmark.


*** IBuffer Marking and Operating
[[file:images/casual-ibuffer-main-screenshot.png]]

Buffers can be marked using different criteria. Marked buffers can be operated on. Common operations include saving and deleting buffers. Note that deleting a buffer populated with a visited file is /not the same/ as deleting the visited file.

From the main menu shown above, control of the display and find/replace operations are offered.

Note that the menu item “{{{kbd(RET)}}} Visit/Toggle” has "do what I mean"  (DWIM) behavior. If the point is currently on a filter group (described below) then pressing the {{{kbd(RET)}}} key will toggle the visibility of items matching that filter group. Otherwise, it will visit (open) the buffer.

As with other Casual user interfaces, the ability to jump to a bookmark is available.

*** IBuffer Filtering
#+VINDEX: casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu

[[file:images/casual-ibuffer-filter-screenshot.png]]


IBuffer is embarrasingly rich in the ways it can filter buffers. Once mastered, IBuffer filtering offers a way to create different views on your buffer list, enabling you to tailor bespoke views for different workflows. Such capability comes with a price though: you'll need to understand how IBuffer wants to organize filters.

Key is the concept of a /Filter Group/ which is IBuffer's analog to a Dired subdirectory ([[info:emacs#Subdirectories in Dired]]). But whereas a subdirectory only maps to a file system directory, a filter group can be constructed from a diverse set of rules to categorize a buffer.

IBuffer organizes filtering with the following taxonomy:

1. *Filter rule*
   
   The smallest unit of filtering. There are many types of filter rules:
   - filter by major mode
   - filter by derived mode
   - filter by buffer name
   - filter by buffer content
   - filter by basename
   - filter by directory name
   - filter by filename
   - filter by file extension
   - filter by modified buffers
   - filter by an arbitrary Lisp predicate
   - filter by buffer size
   - filter by special buffers
   - filter by buffers visiting files

    Casual IBuffer makes the design decision to *not* enumerate the above in a menu, delegating the work of filter selection to the command  ~ibuffer-filter-chosen-by-completion~.
    
2. *Filter*

   A /filter/ is a logical combination of filter rules. Logic operators such as AND (&), OR (|) and NOT (!) are used to compose rules into a /filter/. A single filter rule can also be construed as a filter.

   Properties of filters:

   - A filter can be defined and saved for subsequent use.
     - Filters are saved in the customizable variable =ibuffer-saved-filters=.
     - Multiple filters can be applied at the same time to a set of buffers.
   - Multiple filters are applied in LIFO order. Removing a filter is a "pop" operation.
     - Rules that are combined with a logic operator are treated as a single element of the LIFO stack.
     - To individually edit the combination, use the /Decompose/ command to remove the logic operator first.

3. *Filter Group*

   A filter group is set of filters. The set itself is named with an identifier that is user-defined.

   Properties of filter groups:

   - A filter group can be defined and saved for subsequent use but with a special qualifier:
     - Filter groups are only saved as a collection (more below) in the customizable variable =ibuffer-saved-filter-groups=. A filter group can not be saved individually.
   - Multiple filter groups can be applied to partition the buffer list.
   - Multiple filter groups are applied in LIFO order. Removing a filter group is a "pop" operation.
     - Similar LIFO and decompose behavior applicable to a filter group is supported.

4. *Filter Group Collection*

   A /collection/ is a set of filter groups that can be named with a user-defined identifier. Only one collection can be applied to a buffer list at a time. However, many different collections can be defined, allowing for different views of the same buffer list.
   
*Creating Filters*

The basic procedure for making a filter that applies to the entire buffer list is as follows:

1. From the *Filter* menu, create a filter via /(SPC) Rule.../ and some desired combination of operators.
2. Save the filter via /(s) Save.../. You will be prompted to provide a name for the filter. This filter will be saved in the variable =ibuffer-saved-filters=.
3. To recall this filter at a subsequent time, use /(r) Switch to.../ in the *Add* section of the *Filter* menu.

*Creating a Collection of Filter Groups*

Here is where the taxonomy becomes significant as the IBuffer command set unfortunately does not provide much observability on edit operations to filters.

1. Create a filter as described above.
2. In the *Add* section of the *Filter* menu, select /(g) Create Filter Group.../ to convert the filter into a filter group. You will be prompted to name the filter group. This group name will be enclosed by square brackets [].
3. Multiple filter groups can be created by repeating steps 1 and 2 above. Note that when constructing a filter group, the IBuffer window will /not/ provide observability of existing filter groups on the buffer list.
4. You can save the set of filter groups as a /collection/ in the *Collection* section with the command /(S) Save.../. You will be prompted to name the collection. Note that only one collection can be used at a time in IBuffer.

Out of the box, it is best to think of the IBuffer commands for editing buffer filters as a kit of parts and an arguably incomplete one at that. The Casual IBuffer filter menu (=casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu=) is my attempt to build a comprehensible filter editor UI from this kit. Whether it succeeds in being comprehensible is left to user feedback.


*** IBuffer Sorting
#+VINDEX: casual-ibuffer-sortby-tmenu

[[file:images/casual-ibuffer-sortby-screenshot.png]]

The buffer list can be sorted using different criteria as shown in the screenshot above.

Sort ordering can be reversed via the /Invert/ command.

*** IBuffer Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “{{{kbd(u)}}} Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual IBuffer will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus. The following mapping is shown in the table below:

| Name      | Plain    | Unicode |
|-----------+----------+---------|
| :previous | Previous | ↑       |
| :next     | Next     | ↓       |
| :marked   | Marked   | ❯       |
| :group    | Group    | []      |
| :jump     | Jump     | 🚀     |
