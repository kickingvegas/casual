Casual EditKit provides a user interface for the numerous editing commands offered by Emacs. Its top-level library is ~casual-editkit~. As text editing is a core feature of Emacs, the menus provided here are intended to be made available in a global fashion for buffers that are intended to be edited.

[[file:images/casual-editkit-main-screenshot.png]]

Casual EditKit endeavors to surface the many different editing commands offered by Emacs via Transient menus. The main menu (~casual-editkit-main-tmenu~) both demonstrates and provides a reference to all EditKit menus. Motivated users can customize this menu to their taste.

A reference menu (~casual-editkit-main-tmenu~) illustrating nearly all the different menus offered by Casual EditKit is provided. This menu can be used “as-is” with your binding of preference. For consistency with other Casual Packages, the binding {{{kbd(C-o)}}} is used in the example below. Other candidate bindings include {{{kbd(M-o)}}} and {{{kbd(F10)}}}. To facilitate default access to this menu, the configuration below sets this binding to be global which can be overridden per mode. This is /not/ mandatory and users are free to integrate Casual EditKit into their Emacs configuration however they see fit. 

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-global-set "C-o" #'casual-editkit-main-tmenu)
#+end_src

For motivated users desiring a bespoke solution, it is recommended that they use Casual EditKit as a library of menus to build their own workflows.

*** Window management
#+CINDEX: Window management
#+VINDEX: casual-editkit-window-tmenu
This menu provides support for different Emacs window management commands. Note that in Emacs, a window ([[info:elisp#Basic Windows]]) is defined differently than its usage in contemporary graphical user interfaces.

[[file:images/casual-editkit-window-screenshot.png]]

If the variable ~casual-lib-use-unicode~ is set to ~t~, then Unicode symbols are used in the labels.

#+CINDEX: Search & Replace commands

This is because some commands have variants involving direction and whether to search using a regexp. Commands that support direction will by default operate forward of the current point if ~--backward~ is not enabled.

[[file:images/casual-editkit-search-screenshot.png]]

*** Open commands
#+CINDEX: Open commands

*** Tool commands
#+CINDEX: Tool commands

This menu can be modified ([[info:transient#Modifying Existing Transients]]) to support narrowing in other modes, particularly those that are packaged with Emacs. For example, if one wanted narrowing support for Markdown ([[https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/][markdown-mode]]), the following initialization code can be used.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (transient-append-suffix 'casual-editkit-narrow-tmenu '(0 0)
     ["Markdown"
      :if (lambda () (derived-mode-p 'markdown-mode))
      ("s" "Subtree" markdown-narrow-to-subtree)

#+end_src

Those commands will instead apply to the current buffer. The variables listed above can be more permanently set via the ~customize-variable~ command.
