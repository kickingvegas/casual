Casual Image is a user interface for Image Mode ([[info:emacs#Image Mode]]). Its top level library is ~casual-image~.

Resizing an image is supported if ImageMagick 6 or 7 is installed. This interface deviates significantly with naming conventions used by ~image-mode~ to be more in alignment with conventional image editing tools.

*** Image Resize
#+CINDEX: Image Resize

If ImageMagick (version 6 or 7) is installed, Casual Image can resize an image using it. The Transient ~casual-image-resize-tmenu~ is a streamlined interface to the ImageMagick ~-resize~ function.

Note that if the image file has been modified, the resize interface will be disabled. Save the image file before resizing.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Image Resize Options
- (g) Geometry - [[https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry][ImageMagick specifier]] for the resize geometry.
- (o) Output to another file - If enabled, then the user will be prompted for a different output file, else it will /irreversibly/ update the current image file.
- (t) Type - Specify if /adaptive/ or /interpolative/ resizing should be used. If nothing is specified then /standard/ resizing is used.

*** Image Unicode Symbol Support

By enabling “{{{kbd(u)}}} Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Image will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus. 

*** Image Mode Command Naming

Casual Image makes a number of opinionated changes to the naming of commands provided by ~image-mode~. 

The table below shows the mapping between names used by Casual to commands provided by ~image-mode~.
