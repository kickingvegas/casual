Casual Image is a user interface for Image Mode ([[info:emacs#Image Mode]]). Its top level library is ~casual-image~.

Resizing an image is supported if ImageMagick 6 or 7 is installed. This interface deviates significantly with naming conventions used by ~image-mode~ to be more in alignment with conventional image editing tools.

If ImageMagick (version 6 or 7) is installed, Casual Image can resize an image using it. The Transient ~casual-image-resize-tmenu~ is a streamlined interface to the ImageMagick ~-resize~ function.

Note that if the image file has been modified, the resize interface will be disabled. Save the image file before resizing.
