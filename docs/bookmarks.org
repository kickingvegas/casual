#+CINDEX: Bookmarks Install

To install Casual Bookmarks, add the following line to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-bookmarks-tmenu)
#+end_src

Use these keybindings to configure the bookmark list to be consistent with keybindings used by Casual Bookmarks.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set bookmark-bmenu-mode-map "J" #'bookmark-jump)
#+end_src

Casual Bookmarks also includes the keymap ~casual-bookmarks-main-menu~ which inserts a /Bookmarks/ menu into the main menu bar as shown below.

[[file:images/bookmarks-main-menu.png]]

To enable this, add the following configuration to your initialization file.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-bookmarks)
  (easy-menu-add-item global-map '(menu-bar)
                      casual-bookmarks-main-menu
                      "Tools")
#+end_src

While not necessary, having the current bookmark highlighted is convenient. Enable  ~hl-line-mode~ for the bookmark list as shown below.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'hl-line)
  (add-hook 'bookmark-bmenu-mode-hook #'hl-line-mode)
#+end_src

Finally, customize the variable ~bookmark-save-flag~ to the value ~1~ to ensure that your bookmark changes are always saved.

The above guidance largely extends the work done in the blog post [[http://yummymelon.com/devnull/using-bookmarks-in-emacs-like-you-do-in-web-browsers.html][Using Bookmarks in Emacs like you do in Web Browsers]].
