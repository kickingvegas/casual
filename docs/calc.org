To install Casual Calc, add the following lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set calc-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-calc-tmenu)
  (keymap-set calc-alg-map "C-o" #'casual-calc-tmenu)

To launch Calc, invoke  ~M-x calc~. When the point is in the Calc window, invoke {{{kbd(C-o)}}} (or a binding of your choosing) to launch the Casual Calc interface.

For nearly all menus, algebraic entry via the {{{kbd(')}}} binding is available, as well as basic calculator operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and stack operations (pop, enter).

Casual Calc organizes its main menu into the following sections:

- Calc :: Commands for common calculator functions.
- Constants ::  Common math constants.
- Operators :: Common math operators.
- Stack :: Commands for stack operations.
- Arithmetic :: Entry point for sub-menus of commands classified as arithmetic operations.
- Functions :: Entry point for sub-menus of commands organized into different classes of functionality.
- Settings :: Entry point for sub-menus of commands to configure Calc settings.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Calc Basics

It helps to know some basics about Calc.

- Calc is a stack-based calculator that supports both RPN and algebraic style entry.
  - By default it uses RPN entry, but this can be changed to algebraic.
- Stack based operations are always RPN-style.
- Undo has the keybinding ~U~, redo is ~D~.
- The top of the stack is referred to as ~1:~
- Calc vectors are punctuated with ~[~ and ~]~ (e.g. ~[2 3]~)  Matrix values are represented as vectors within a vector. For example, ~[[1 0] [0 1]]~ is a square diagonal matrix.
- Calc vector indexes are 1-offset.
- Intervals
  - Inclusive intervals are represented as [ùëõ..ùëö], where ùëõ < ùëö.
  - Exclusive intervals are represented as (ùëõ..ùëö), where ùëõ < ùëö.
  - Any combination of lower and upper bounds set to be inclusive or exclusive is supported.
- Complex numbers are entered as (ùëü, ùëñ), where ùëü is the real part and ùëñ is the imaginary.
- Radix numbers are entered as ùëè#ùëõ where ùëè is the base value and ùëõ is the number. For example entering ~2#0101~ will put ~5~ on the stack.
- H:M:S values are default entered as ‚Ñé@ ùëö" ùë†'.
- Org-mode active timestamps can be entered into Calc.
- The top of the stack (1:) can be edited by pressing the ~`~ key.
- Entering a single quote (') will prompt you for an algebraic entry.
