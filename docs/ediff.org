Casual Ediff is a user interface for Ediff ([[info:ediff#Top][Ediff]]), a visual interface for the Unix diff and patch utilities. Casual Ediff strives to improve the usability of Ediff by simplifying the following workflows:

- Comparing a modified and uncommitted version-controlled file with its most recent commit.
- Resolving a merge conflicted file.

Notable features of Casual Ediff include:

- Context aware menu items.
- Menu design tuned for side-by-side comparison.
- For a merge conflict, the ability to resolve using both the conflicting diff versions.

Shown below is screenshot of the Casual Ediff in action for a version-controlled file.

** Ediff Install
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ediff-install
:END:

#+CINDEX: Ediff Install

In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~casual-ediff-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (casual-ediff-install) ; run this to enable Casual Ediff
  (add-hook 'ediff-keymap-setup-hook
            (lambda ()
              (keymap-set ediff-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-ediff-tmenu)))
#+end_src

If the current buffer is loaded with a version-controlled file, then the difference between that buffer's content with its most recent commit can be seen with the command ~casual-ediff-revision~. It is often convenient to bind this command. Shown below is an example of such a binding.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-global-set "<f15>" #'casual-ediff-revision)
#+end_src

Users who wish to call ~casual-ediff-revision~ via mouse can use the command ~casual-ediff-revision-from-menu~. An example of its use is shown in the source example below (note this is a code fragment). 

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (easy-menu-add-item
       menu nil
       ["Ediff revision…"
        casual-ediff-revision-from-menu
        :visible (and (bound-and-true-p buffer-file-name)
                      (vc-registered (buffer-file-name)))
        :help "Ediff this file with revision"])
#+end_src


#+TEXINFO: @subsubheading Ediff Variables

Casual Ediff recommends the following variables be set as follows:

| Variable                    | Value                     |
|-----------------------------+---------------------------|
| ediff-keep-variants         | nil                       |
| ediff-window-setup-function | ediff-setup-windows-plain |
| ediff-split-window-function | split-window-horizontally |

** Ediff Usage
#+CINDEX: Ediff Usage

[[file:images/casual-ediff-basic-screenshot.png]]

Casual Ediff (~casual-ediff-tmenu~) is invoked from the Ediff control window, typically using the binding {{{kbd(C-o)}}} (or your binding of preference).

The menu comprises of sections laid out horizontally that correspond to source of the diffs. The number of sections and their contents are context-dependent on the type of content to be compared.

The following sections are offered in the menu:

- A :: Context-dependent commands for Ediff buffer A.
- B :: Context-dependent commands for Ediff buffer B.
- C :: Context-dependent commands for Ediff buffer C, if available.
- Diff :: Ediff commands not related to a specific buffer.
  
Navigation between diffs are bound to the {{{kbd(p)}}} and {{{kbd(n)}}} keys for previous and next diff respectively. 

*** Ediff Basic Operation

[[file:images/casual-ediff-basic-screenshot.png]]

If two writeable files are compared, Casual Ediff provides the ability to write diffs from either side A or B to each other. Unwanted changes to a side can be restored. 

*** Comparing a Version-Controlled File

[[file:images/casual-ediff-screenshot.png]]

Casual Ediff provides a dedicated command to compare a version-controlled file with its latest commit: ~casual-ediff-revision~. This command short-circuits the prompts asked for by the command  ~ediff-revision~ which asks for the source file and the revision to compare it to. Call ~casual-ediff-revision~ from the window of a version-controlled file, typically by key binding of preference.

The A side will hold the last committed revision of a file. The B side will hold current source file.

Users desiring a mouse-driven approach to calling ~casual-ediff-revision~ should use the command ~casual-ediff-revision-from-menu~ invoked from either the top-level or context menu.

Note that both ~casual-ediff-revision~ and ~casual-ediff-revision-from-menu~ will checkpoint the window configuration before invoking the Ediff session and restore it after the session is complete.

*** Resolving a Merge Conflict

[[file:images/casual-ediff-merge-conflict.png]]

Magit offers a means of invoking Ediff to resolve a merge conflict via the {{{kbd(e)}}} binding from the ~magit-status~ ([[info:magit#Status Buffer][(magit) Status Buffer]]) window.

Calling ~casual-ediff-tmenu~ will show the menu shown above. Note that in the C section, there are commands to merge both the variant A and variant B diffs using the bindings {{{kbd(mab)}}} or {{{kbd(mba)}}}, depending on the desired order the diffs are to be merged.


*** Ediff Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “{{{kbd(u)}}} Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Ediff will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.
