* Casual Help

Casual Help is a user interface for ~help-mode~, a major mode for viewing help text and navigating references in it.

* Install

In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~casual-help-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-help) ; optional
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-help-tmenu)
#+end_src

~casual-help-tmenu~ deviates from the default bindings of ~help-mode-map~ as shown in the table below.

| Default Binding | Casual Binding | Command                               | Notes                                      |
|-----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| l               | M-[            | help-go-back                          | Make consistent with Casual Info behavior. |
| r               | M-]            | help-go-forward                       | Make consistent with Casual Info behavior. |
| n               | N              | help-goto-next-page                   | Use to navigate to next page.              |
| p               | P              | help-goto-previous-page               | Use to navigate to previous page.          |
|                 | n              | casual-lib-browser-forward-paragraph  | Use to navigate paragraph forward.         |
|                 | p              | casual-lib-browser-backward-paragraph | Use to navigate paragraph backward.        |

The following keybindings are recommended to support consistent behavior between ~help-mode~ and ~casual-help-tmenu~.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "M-[" #'help-go-back)
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "M-]" #'help-go-forward)
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "p" #'casual-lib-browse-backward-paragraph)
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "n" #'casual-lib-browse-forward-paragraph)
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "P" #'help-goto-previous-page)
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "N" #'help-goto-next-page)
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "j" #'forward-button)
  (keymap-set help-mode-map "k" #'backward-button)
#+end_src

** helpful mode

"[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] is an alternative to the built-in Emacs help that provides much
more contextual information." It works as a drop-in replacement for the
base emacs ~help~ mode, and the above installation instructions for
~casual-help-tmenu~ work, /mutatis mutandis/ (just use
~helpful-mode-map~), for ~helpful~.

* Usage

** Basic Usage

After invoking help via a ~describe-~ command, invoke ~casual-help-tmenu~ using the binding ~C-o~ (or your binding of preference).

The following sections are offered in the menu:

- Navigation :: Navigation commands with the document.
- History :: Navigate history of help invocations.
- Link :: Navigate to different references in the help buffer.
- Describe :: Get help for different Elisp types.
- Info :: If available, then open this help topic in [[file:info.org][Info]].
- Source :: Show the Elisp source. If the help displayed is for a customizable variable, then show a customize menu item.

*** Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Man will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.
