@top Casual User Guide

Version: 2.11.2

Casual is a project to re-imagine the primary user interface for Emacs using keyboard-driven menus.

Emacs has many commands that are easy to forget if not used frequently. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offers discoverability and recognition. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient (@ref{Top,,,transient,}) in Emacs core allows for building menus that are keyboard-driven instead. This appeals to users that prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

Casual organizes itself primarily around the different built-in modes Emacs provides. For each mode Casual supports, there is a bespoke designed library of Transient menus for that mode's command set.

Casual has no aims to be a mutually exclusive user interface. All existing user interfaces to commands (keybinding, mini-buffer prompt, mouse menus) are still available to the user.

To learn more about the motivations and design considerations for Casual and to see it at work, please watch the presentation @uref{https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/casual/, “Re-imagining the Emacs User Experience with Casual Suite”} from EmacsConf 2024.

@section Motivations

@cindex Motivations

@subheading Goals

@itemize
@item
To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI toolkit for common Emacs commands.

@item
To allow for casual discovery and use of infrequently used Emacs commands.

@item
To be a frequently used interface for modes supported by Casual.
@end itemize


@subheading Non-Goals

@itemize
@item
Full coverage of all Emacs commands.

Casual is not intended to be a power user tool nor is it intended to be a replacement for mouse-driven menus. Casual has no intent to exhaustively cover all modes available in Emacs with keyboard-driven menus.

@item
Strict adherence to Emacs command naming.

While Casual is @strong{mostly} in alignment with Emacs command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.

@item
No intention is made by Casual to help on-board users to the existing default bindings of a mode, nor  cater to users who already know them.

That said, many existing default Emacs bindings are replicated in Casual. Such correspondence should be considered incidental.

@item
UX Stability (for now).

Given that Casual is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.
@end itemize

Editorially, all design decisions for Casual are ultimately the opinion of Charles Y@. Choi.

@node Transient Conventions
@section Transient Conventions

@cindex Transient Conventions

Casual is built using Transient menus and as such adopts its default behavior.

Each menu item has a key and a label. The key is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta @kbd{M-} or control @kbd{C-} key.

Transient supports nested menus. Exiting a menu can be done in two ways:

@itemize
@item
@kbd{C-g} (@code{transient-quit-one}) will exit the current sub-menu and return you back to its parent menu.

@item
@kbd{C-q} (@code{transient-quit-all}) will exit you completely from a Transient menu stack.
@end itemize

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the @kbd{?} key or @kbd{C-h} will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (@kbd{C-u}) and an optional argument can be entered before selecting a menu item.

For Transient menus that offer setting different values, the following bindings will allow you save them:

@itemize
@item
@kbd{C-x s} (@code{transient-set})

Saves the value of the active transient for this Emacs session.

@item
@kbd{C-x C-s} (@code{transient-save})

Saves the value of the active transient persistently across Emacs sessions.

@item
@kbd{C-x C-k} (@code{transient-reset})

Clears the set and saved values of the active transient.

@node A Note on Package Dependencies
@section A Note on Package Dependencies

Casual requires a recent installation of Transient 0.9.0+ from either @uref{https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html, ELPA} or @uref{https://melpa.org/#/transient, MELPA}. If your version of Emacs is ≤ 30 but also includes Transient as a built-in package, you will need to set the customizable variable @code{package-install-upgrade-built-in} to @code{t} to enable updating it via @code{package.el}.  Set this variable and proceed with installing Casual.  Alternately invoking @code{package-install} with a prefix (@code{C-u}) will temporarily coerce the update of dependent built-in packages (example: @code{C-u M-x package-install} @code{casual}).

If you already have the latest version of Magit installed (via @uref{https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html, non-GNU ELPA} or @uref{https://melpa.org/#/magit, MELPA}), you can bypass the above instruction as Magit already includes the Transient package as a dependency.

@node Upgrading to Casual 1x to 2x
@section Upgrading to Casual 1.x to 2.x

If you have been using an earlier version 1.x of Casual, thank you. Please use the following guidance:

* If you have used @code{use-package} to configure Casual::
@end menu

@node If you do not use @code{use-package} to configure Casual
@subsection If you do not use @code{use-package} to configure Casual

Before installing Casual, you should update all of your existing Casual packages. This is most easily done via the package menu buffer (@ref{Package Menu,,,emacs,}) . After updating your packages, install the @code{casual} package.

Migrate your existing Casual packages from 1.x to 2.x by running the following commands:

@lisp
M-x load-library casual
M-x casual-upgrade-base-to-version-2
@end lisp

Any Casual v1.x packages that have been superseded by this package will be uninstalled.

While not necessary, it is recommended to run @code{M-x package-autoremove} to purge any dangling dependent packages. Cautious readers can choose to audit any packages that are targeted to be removed.

@node If you have used @code{use-package} to configure Casual
@subsection If you have used @code{use-package} to configure Casual

For version 2.x going forward, I (Charles Choi) have decided to not offer any documented guidance on using @code{use-package} to configure Casual due my lack of expertise in using it. I leave it to more skilled readers to determine how to best use @code{use-package} (@ref{Top,,,use-package,}) for their configuration. Please also note that this is not a prohibition on using @code{use-package} with Casual. I am simply admitting that I don't know how to use it. 

That said, if you have used @code{:ensure t} to install a superseded package, you @emph{must} remove that configuration. After doing so, please follow the above instructions for installing @code{casual}.

@node UX Conventions
@chapter UX Conventions

@cindex UX Conventions

The Casual menus share common user experience (UX) conventions to facilitate usability. This section details this.

@subheading Common Menu Navigation

Casual organizes a mode's command set into a menu hierarchy. As the user descends down different menu levels, the user is given the option to dismiss the current menu or to dismiss completely all menu levels descended. Transient provides a standard convention for menu dismissal via the @kbd{C-g} (@code{transient-quit-one}) and @kbd{C-q} (@code{transient-quit-all}) commands. By default Transient does not display these commands in the menu though, rather they make the assumption that the user already knows these bindings.

@vindex casual-lib-hide-navigation
In contrast, Casual makes these bindings explicitly known to user by displaying them at the bottom of the menu. Users who wish to have them hidden can set the customizable variable @code{casual-lib-hide-navigation} to a non-nil value. This can be changed from a Casual mode-specific settings menu.

@subheading Settings Menu

Most all Casual main menus support invoking a mode-specific settings menu via the binding @kbd{,}.

@subheading Unicode Symbol Support
@vindex casual-lib-use-unicode

The customizable variable named @code{casual-lib-use-unicode} which when non-nil will inform Casual menus to use Unicode symbol labels whenever supported. This can be changed from Casual mode-specific settings menu.

If @code{casual-lib-use-unicode} is set to @code{t}, it is also recommended that the variable @code{transient-align-variable-pitch} also be set to @code{t}.

@subheading Common Key Bindings

Listed below are keybindings which are common among Casual menus. 

@itemize
@item
@kbd{J} Jump to Bookmark…

Casual places great emphasis on using Emacs Bookmarks to track different places of note. The binding @kbd{J} is used in many main menus to support this.

@item
@kbd{,} Settings›

Many modes have settings specific to them. The binding @kbd{,} is used in many main menus to support the configuration of mode-specific settings.

@item
@kbd{j} Goto… (mode specific)

Many modes provide a list of items. If a command exists that allows the user to jump to a specified item, the binding @kbd{j} is mapped to it.

@item
@kbd{n} Next, @kbd{p} Previous

For modes that provide a list of items, navigation to a next or previous item is bound to @kbd{n} and @kbd{p} respectively.

@item
@kbd{[} Next Section, @kbd{]} Previous Section

For modes that organize items into sections, navigation to a next or previous section is bound to @kbd{[} and @kbd{]} respectively.
@end itemize


@subheading Label Conventions

Casual annotates menu labels with the following conventions:

@table @asis
@item ‘…’
If the label ends with an ellipsis, then the command will prompt the user for input.
@item ‘›’
If the label ends with a right-pointing arrow, then the item will raise a sub-menu.
@item ‘ⁿ’
If the label ends with the superscript ‘ⁿ’, then the command supports a prefix @kbd{C-u}. 
@end table

@node Casual Modes
@chapter Casual Modes

@cindex Casual Modes

Casual employs the convention of using the same keybinding to invoke a mode-specific main menu. This keybinding is re-used for each mode-specific keymap. The document recommends the default keybinding @code{C-o} for this purpose. Users who prefer a different binding are always free to use another.

Casual is organized into different libraries typically using the naming convention of @code{casual-<mode name>}. Each library has within it a ``main menu'' which serves as the top level interface to access functions related to that mode. All main menus are auto-loaded, which means that it is not necessary to include a @code{require} call to load that library.

The following modes are supported by Casual:

* Bib@TeX{}::
* Bookmarks::

@node Bib@TeX{}
@section Bib@TeX{}

@cindex BibTeX
@cindex bibtex
@vindex casual-bibtex-tmenu

Casual Bib@TeX{} is an opinionated user interface for Bib@TeX{} mode (@ref{TeX Mode,info ``(emacs) @TeX{} Mode'',,emacs,}), a major mode for working with Bib@TeX{} files (@uref{https://bibtex.eu, Bib@TeX{} Guide}).

A Bib@TeX{} file is typically named using the suffix @code{.bib} to identify its file type.

To appreciate the benefits of Casual Bib@TeX{}, it helps to understand what BibTex is and what Bib@TeX{} mode offers.

Bib@TeX{} is a database schema for bibliography data. This data is best understood as a collection of records (or entries) that is stored in a plain-text file. Multiple text files can be supported. While most tooling for Bib@TeX{} is tuned for @LaTeX{} documentation workflows, Bib@TeX{} can be used as generalized storage for bibliography data. Org provides extensive support for citing using Bib@TeX{} (@ref{Citation handling,info ``(org) Citation handling'',,org,}).

As a Bib@TeX{} file is plain-text based, any plain-text editor can be used to edit it. This flexibility is problematic as plain-text editors will not enforce the schema of Bib@TeX{} by default.

Emacs distinguishes itself from other editors in that support for working with Bib@TeX{} files is built-in with the package @code{bibtex}.

The @code{bibtex} package provides commands for both navigating and editing Bib@TeX{} data structures (entries and the fields within an entry) in a quasi-``form-based'' way.

Casual Bib@TeX{} organizes and augments Bib@TeX{} mode commands into a keyboard-driven menu.

The screenshot below shows the menu for Casual Bib@TeX{}.

In your initialization file, bind the Transient @code{casual-bibtex-tmenu} to your key binding of preference in @code{bibtex-mode-map}. The binding @kbd{M-m} is suggested so as to not conflict with @kbd{C-o} that is bound to @code{casual-editkit-main-tmenu}. (@ref{EditKit Install})

@lisp
(keymap-set bibtex-mode-map "M-m" #'casual-bibtex-tmenu)

@code{casual-bibtex-tmenu} is opinionated in making editing and navigation commands emulate a form-based interface (@uref{https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form-based_interface#:~:text=A%20form%2Dbased%20interface%20is,the%20fields%20that%20accept%20it., form-based interface}) in a @code{bibtex-mode} window.

@node Creating Updating and Deleting Bib@TeX{} Structures
@subsubsection Creating, Updating, and Deleting Bib@TeX{} Structures

@cindex BibTeX CRUD

@image{images/casual-bibtex-screenshot,,,,png}

In Casual Bib@TeX{}, CRUD (CReate, Update, Delete) operations for entry and field structures are intended to be achieved through their respective commands. This contrasts with manual editing of a buffer to achieve the same end, which is prone to errors.

@subheading Creating an Entry

To create a new entry, use the “@kbd{A} Add…” command. You will be prompted in the mini-buffer with completion support for the entry type. This new entry will be inserted relative to existing entry where the point is with all fields supported by the entry type enumerated.  Fields with the temporary prefix of ``ALT'' or ``OPT'' denote a field that is alternate or optional. Use the command “@kbd{o} Remove OPT/ALT” to remove this prefix. 

When all desired information for a Bib@TeX{} entry has been entered, it can be ``cleaned'' using the command “@kbd{C-c} Clean”. Cleaning an entry will:

@enumerate
@item
Generate a unique citation key, if needed.
@item
Remove all unused fields.
@end enumerate

By default, cleaning an entry will not format (or ``fill'') the entry. This can be changed by setting the customizable variable @code{bibtex-clean-entry-hook} to include the command @code{bibtex-fill-entry}. This can be done from ``Hooks'' section in the Settings menu (@ref{Bib@TeX{} Settings, , Settings)}. 

@subheading Creating a Field

To create a new field, use the “@kbd{a} Add…” command. You will be prompted in the mini-buffer with completion support for the field type. This new field will be inserted relative to existing field where the point is.

There are two components to a field:

@table @asis
@item key
the field name, referred to in the menu as 'k'.
@item value
the value of the field, referred to in the menu as 'v'.
@end table

A ``brute-force'' command to enumerate all fields for an entry is provided by the “@kbd{u} Update…” command. Clean the entry to remove all unpopulated fields after using it.

@subheading BibTeX mode has its own kill-ring

Bib@TeX{} has its own kill-ring variable @code{bibtex-entry-kill-ring} which the following menu commands use:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{c} Copy∙ k,v
Copy the whole field, both key and value.
@item @kbd{C} Copy∙
Copy the entry.
@item @kbd{k} Kill∙

@subheading Calc Basics

It helps to know some basics about Calc.

@itemize
@item
Calc is a stack-based calculator that supports both RPN and algebraic style entry.
@itemize
@item
By default it uses RPN entry, but this can be changed to algebraic.
@end itemize
@item
Stack based operations are always RPN-style.
@item
Undo has the keybinding @code{U}, redo is @code{D}.
@item
The top of the stack is referred to as @code{1:}
@item
Calc vectors are punctuated with @code{[} and @code{]} (e.g. @code{[2 3]})  Matrix values are represented as vectors within a vector. For example, @code{[[1 0] [0 1]]} is a square diagonal matrix.
@item
Calc vector indexes are 1-offset.
@item
Intervals
@itemize
@item
Inclusive intervals are represented as [𝑛..𝑚], where 𝑛 < 𝑚.
@item
Exclusive intervals are represented as (𝑛..𝑚), where 𝑛 < 𝑚.
@item
Any combination of lower and upper bounds set to be inclusive or exclusive is supported.
@end itemize
@item
Complex numbers are entered as (𝑟, 𝑖), where 𝑟 is the real part and 𝑖 is the imaginary.
@item
Radix numbers are entered as 𝑏#𝑛 where 𝑏 is the base value and 𝑛 is the number. For example entering @code{2#0101} will put @code{5} on the stack.
@item
H:M:S values are default entered as ℎ@@ 𝑚" 𝑠'.
@item
Org-mode active timestamps can be entered into Calc.
@item
The top of the stack (1:) can be edited by pressing the @code{`} key.
@item
Entering a single quote (') will prompt you for an algebraic entry.

Whenever the @code{calendar} window (showing three months) is raised, the Casual user interface is invoked via the command @code{casual-calendar}. This command is typically bound to a keybinding (e.g. @kbd{C-o}). 

Casual Calendar organizes its main menu into the following sections:

@table @asis
@item Navigation
Commands to move the point to a desired date, adjusting the view as necessary.

@item Conversions
Commands to convert a date across different calendar systems.

@item Holidays

To convert a Gregorian date to Lunar (Chinese):

@enumerate
@item
Move cursor (point) in Calendar window to desired date. (The command “(g) Goto…” can be used to accomplish this.)
@item
Choose “(c) Date at Cursor”.
@end enumerate

To convert a Lunar (Chinese) date to Gregorian:

@enumerate
@item

@section Ediff

@cindex Ediff
@vindex casual-ediff-tmenu

Casual Ediff is a user interface for Ediff (@ref{Top,Ediff,,ediff,}), a visual interface for the Unix diff and patch utilities. Casual Ediff strives to improve the usability of Ediff by simplifying the following workflows:

@itemize
@item
Comparing a modified and uncommitted version-controlled file with its most recent commit.
@item
Resolving a merge conflicted file.
@end itemize

Notable features of Casual Ediff include:

@itemize
@item
Context aware menu items.
@item
Menu design tuned for side-by-side comparison.
@item
For a merge conflict, the ability to resolve using both the conflicting diff versions.
@end itemize

Shown below is screenshot of the Casual Ediff in action for a version-controlled file.

@subsection Ediff Install

@cindex Ediff Install

In your initialization file, bind the Transient @code{casual-ediff-tmenu} to your key binding of preference.

@lisp

          (lambda ()
            (keymap-set ediff-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-ediff-tmenu)))
@end lisp

If the current buffer is loaded with a version-controlled file, then the difference between that buffer's content with its most recent commit can be seen with the command @code{casual-ediff-revision}. It is often convenient to bind this command. Shown below is an example of such a binding.

@lisp
(keymap-global-set "<f15>" #'casual-ediff-revision)
@end lisp

Users who wish to call @code{casual-ediff-revision} via mouse can use the command @code{casual-ediff-revision-from-menu}. An example of its use is shown in the source example below (note this is a code fragment). 

@lisp
(easy-menu-add-item

@image{images/casual-ediff-basic-screenshot,,,,png}

Casual Ediff (@code{casual-ediff-tmenu}) is invoked from the Ediff control window, typically using the binding @kbd{C-o} (or your binding of preference).

The menu comprises of sections laid out horizontally that correspond to source of the diffs. The number of sections and their contents are context-dependent on the type of content to be compared.

The following sections are offered in the menu:

@table @asis
@item A
Context-dependent commands for Ediff buffer A@.
@item B
Context-dependent commands for Ediff buffer B@.
@item C
Context-dependent commands for Ediff buffer C, if available.
@item Diff
Ediff commands not related to a specific buffer.

@subsubsection Ediff Basic Operation

@image{images/casual-ediff-basic-screenshot,,,,png}

If two writeable files are compared, Casual Ediff provides the ability to write diffs from either side A or B to each other. Unwanted changes to a side can be restored.

@node Comparing a Version-Controlled File
@subsubsection Comparing a Version-Controlled File

@image{images/casual-ediff-screenshot,,,,png}

Casual Ediff provides a dedicated command to compare a version-controlled file with its latest commit: @code{casual-ediff-revision}. This command short-circuits the prompts asked for by the command  @code{ediff-revision} which asks for the source file and the revision to compare it to. Call @code{casual-ediff-revision} from the window of a version-controlled file, typically by key binding of preference.

The A side will hold the last committed revision of a file. The B side will hold current source file.

Users desiring a mouse-driven approach to calling @code{casual-ediff-revision} should use the command @code{casual-ediff-revision-from-menu} invoked from either the top-level or context menu.

Note that both @code{casual-ediff-revision} and @code{casual-ediff-revision-from-menu} will checkpoint the window configuration before invoking the Ediff session and restore it after the session is complete.

@node Resolving a Merge Conflict
@subsubsection Resolving a Merge Conflict

Magit offers a means of invoking Ediff to resolve a merge conflict via the @kbd{e} binding from the @code{magit-status} (@ref{Status Buffer,(magit) Status Buffer,,magit,}) window.

Calling @code{casual-ediff-tmenu} will show the menu shown above. Note that in the C section, there are commands to merge both the variant A and variant B diffs using the bindings @kbd{mab} or @kbd{mba}, depending on the desired order the diffs are to be merged.

Casual IBuffer provides a user interface to Emacs IBuffer (@ref{Buffer Menus,emacs#Buffer Menus,,emacs,}), a mode designed for managing buffers. Its top-level library is @code{casual-ibuffer}.

IBuffer is a powerful tool for managing Emacs workflows. As Emacs is often compared to an operating system, through that lens one could compare IBuffer to being a task manager interface, managing instantiated buffers as opposed to processes.

Like with Casual Dired, it is convenient to have the menus for filtering and sorting bound as well. Listed below shows an example of binding @code{casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu} and @code{casual-ibuffer-sortby-tmenu} to @code{F} and @code{s} respectively.

@node IBuffer Marking and Operating
@subsubsection IBuffer Marking and Operating

@image{images/casual-ibuffer-main-screenshot,,,,png}

Buffers can be marked using different criteria. Marked buffers can be operated on. Common operations include saving and deleting buffers. Note that deleting a buffer populated with a visited file is @emph{not the same} as deleting the visited file.

From the main menu shown above, control of the display and find/replace operations are offered.

Note that the menu item “@kbd{@key{RET}} Visit/Toggle” has ``do what I mean''  (DWIM) behavior. If the point is currently on a filter group (described below) then pressing the @kbd{@key{RET}} key will toggle the visibility of items matching that filter group. Otherwise, it will visit (open) the buffer.

As with other Casual user interfaces, the ability to jump to a bookmark is available.

@node IBuffer Filtering
@subsubsection IBuffer Filtering

@vindex casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu

@image{images/casual-ibuffer-filter-screenshot,,,,png}


IBuffer is embarrasingly rich in the ways it can filter buffers. Once mastered, IBuffer filtering offers a way to create different views on your buffer list, enabling you to tailor bespoke views for different workflows. Such capability comes with a price though: you'll need to understand how IBuffer wants to organize filters.

Key is the concept of a @emph{Filter Group} which is IBuffer's analog to a Dired subdirectory (@ref{Subdirectories in Dired,,,emacs,}). But whereas a subdirectory only maps to a file system directory, a filter group can be constructed from a diverse set of rules to categorize a buffer.

IBuffer organizes filtering with the following taxonomy:

@enumerate
@item
@strong{Filter rule}

The smallest unit of filtering. There are many types of filter rules:
@itemize
@item
filter by major mode
@item
filter by derived mode
@item
filter by buffer name
@item
filter by buffer content
@item
filter by basename
@item
filter by directory name
@item
filter by filename
@item
filter by file extension
@item
filter by modified buffers
@item
filter by an arbitrary Lisp predicate
@item
filter by buffer size
@item
filter by special buffers
@item
filter by buffers visiting files

Casual IBuffer makes the design decision to @strong{not} enumerate the above in a menu, delegating the work of filter selection to the command  @code{ibuffer-filter-chosen-by-completion}.
@end itemize

@item
@strong{Filter}

A @emph{filter} is a logical combination of filter rules. Logic operators such as AND (&), OR (|) and NOT (!) are used to compose rules into a @emph{filter}. A single filter rule can also be construed as a filter.

Properties of filters:

@itemize
@item
A filter can be defined and saved for subsequent use.
@itemize
@item
Filters are saved in the customizable variable @samp{ibuffer-saved-filters}.
@item
Multiple filters can be applied at the same time to a set of buffers.
@end itemize
@item
Multiple filters are applied in LIFO order. Removing a filter is a ``pop'' operation.
@itemize
@item
Rules that are combined with a logic operator are treated as a single element of the LIFO stack.
@item
To individually edit the combination, use the @emph{Decompose} command to remove the logic operator first.
@end itemize
@end itemize

@item
@strong{Filter Group}

A filter group is set of filters. The set itself is named with an identifier that is user-defined.

Properties of filter groups:

@itemize
@item
A filter group can be defined and saved for subsequent use but with a special qualifier:
@itemize
@item
Filter groups are only saved as a collection (more below) in the customizable variable @samp{ibuffer-saved-filter-groups}. A filter group can not be saved individually.
@end itemize
@item
Multiple filter groups can be applied to partition the buffer list.
@item
Multiple filter groups are applied in LIFO order. Removing a filter group is a ``pop'' operation.
@itemize
@item
Similar LIFO and decompose behavior applicable to a filter group is supported.
@end itemize
@end itemize

@item
@strong{Filter Group Collection}

A @emph{collection} is a set of filter groups that can be named with a user-defined identifier. Only one collection can be applied to a buffer list at a time. However, many different collections can be defined, allowing for different views of the same buffer list.
@end enumerate

@strong{Creating Filters}

The basic procedure for making a filter that applies to the entire buffer list is as follows:

@enumerate
@item
From the @strong{Filter} menu, create a filter via @emph{(SPC) Rule@dots{}} and some desired combination of operators.
@item
Save the filter via @emph{(s) Save@dots{}}. You will be prompted to provide a name for the filter. This filter will be saved in the variable @samp{ibuffer-saved-filters}.
@item
To recall this filter at a subsequent time, use @emph{(r) Switch to@dots{}} in the @strong{Add} section of the @strong{Filter} menu.
@end enumerate

@strong{Creating a Collection of Filter Groups}

Here is where the taxonomy becomes significant as the IBuffer command set unfortunately does not provide much observability on edit operations to filters.

@enumerate
@item
Create a filter as described above.
@item
In the @strong{Add} section of the @strong{Filter} menu, select @emph{(g) Create Filter Group@dots{}} to convert the filter into a filter group. You will be prompted to name the filter group. This group name will be enclosed by square brackets [].
@item
Multiple filter groups can be created by repeating steps 1 and 2 above. Note that when constructing a filter group, the IBuffer window will @emph{not} provide observability of existing filter groups on the buffer list.
@item
You can save the set of filter groups as a @emph{collection} in the @strong{Collection} section with the command @emph{(S) Save@dots{}}. You will be prompted to name the collection. Note that only one collection can be used at a time in IBuffer.
@end enumerate

Out of the box, it is best to think of the IBuffer commands for editing buffer filters as a kit of parts and an arguably incomplete one at that. The Casual IBuffer filter menu (@samp{casual-ibuffer-filter-tmenu}) is my attempt to build a comprehensible filter editor UI from this kit. Whether it succeeds in being comprehensible is left to user feedback.

@node IBuffer Sorting
@subsubsection IBuffer Sorting

@vindex casual-ibuffer-sortby-tmenu

@image{images/casual-ibuffer-sortby-screenshot,,,,png}

The buffer list can be sorted using different criteria as shown in the screenshot above.

Sort ordering can be reversed via the @emph{Invert} command.

At the top of the menu shows the title ``RE-Builder'' with the target buffer enclosed in parenthesis. The regexp pattern will be applied to the target buffer. The target buffer can be changed with the “@kbd{b} Target buffer” menu item.

Emacs supports three different regexp syntax: 1) read, 2) string, 3) Rx.  Use the “@kbd{x} Syntax” menu item to alter it. The current syntax is shown in parenthesis.

If multiple sub-expressions are in the regexp pattern, then they can be observed via the “@kbd{s} Subexp mode” menu item.

If the regexp pattern entered in ``✳︎RE-Builder✳︎'' finds multiple matches, a match can be navigated to via the  “@kbd{p} Previous” and “@kbd{n} Next” menu items.

@subheading Exporting the Regexp Pattern
Once a desired regexp pattern is defined, there are two menu items that can be used to export (copy) it to the kill-ring for further use.

@itemize
@item
“@kbd{w} Interactive” will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked in an interactive command that requires a regexp (e.g. @code{query-replace-regexp}).
@itemize
@item
This can only be used when the regexp syntax is set to @code{string}.
@item
❗️When yanking (typically @kbd{C-y}) a regexp into an interactive prompt, you @emph{must} have the point/focus in the minibuffer prompt (typically via mouse). Otherwise the desired content can be altered with extra escaping.
@end itemize
@item
“@kbd{c} Code” will copy the regexp to the kill-ring so that it can be yanked into a Elisp code that requires a regexp argument.
@item
“@kbd{g} Interactive grep” will copy the regexp so that it can be used with command that take a GNU grep regex argument.
@itemize
@item
Example commands that do this are @code{dired-do-find-regexp} and @code{dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace}.
@item
